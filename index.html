            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
            Modern web applications are conglomerations of JavaScript written by multiple
            authors: application developers routinely incorporate code from third-party
            libraries, and <i>mashup</i> applications synthesize data and code hosted at different
            sites. In current browsers, a web application's developer and user must trust
            third-party code in libraries not to leak the user's sensitive information from
            within applications. Even worse, in the status quo, the only way to implement
            some mashups is for the user to give her login credentials for one site to the
            operator of another site.  Fundamentally, today's browser security model trades
            privacy for flexibility because it lacks a sufficient mechanism for <i>confining
            untrusted code</i> once it reads sensitive data.
            </p>

            <p>
            COWL (Confinement with Origin Web Labels) is a robust JavaScript confinement system for modern web
            browsers.  COWL introduces label-based <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_access_control">mandatory access
            control</a> to browsing contexts (pages, iframes, etc.) in a way that is fully
            backward-compatible with legacy web content. With COWL,
            developers not only can restrict with whom they share
            data, but also can impose restrictions on how
            their data is disseminated once it is shared. COWL
            achieves <i>both</i> flexibility for developers and
            privacy for users: it allows code to fetch and share data
            as necessary, but once code has read sensitive data, COWL
            confines the code by revoking its right to
            communicate with unauthorized parties.

            <h3>Design</h3>
            The COWL design naturally extends the existing web security model with three
            core primitives on which developers can build privacy-preserving
            web services. These primitives are:
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-12">
            <h4>Labeled contexts</h4>
            <p>
            Today, developers use <i>contexts</i> (<i>e.g.,</i> tabs, pages, and
            iframes) to isolate content from different origins (web sites).
            COWL extends contexts with <i>labels</i>, which encode the origins
            from which a context has read information.
            COWL then uses these labels to restrict how code within a
            context communicates: it confines the code to disallow
            any communication that would result in leaking an origin's sensitive data.
            COWL fits well with existing legacy web sites because it
            imposes these restrictions within the framework of
            existing discretionary access control (DAC) policies, such as the 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy">same-origin policy</a> and 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Security_Policy">CSP</a>.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="col-lg-12">
            <h4>Labeled communication</h4>
            <p>
            To impose restrictions on how third-party code can use sensitive data,
            developers can label data before handing it off to a third-party context (<i>e.g.,</i> using <var>postMessage</var>).
            When the third-party code later decides to use the data, COWL "taints" its
            context's label to confine the executing code.
            This approach differs from the status quo, in which the
            developer must effectively choose between benefiting from the
            functionality of the third-party code or risking the
            leaking of the sensitive data.
            With COWL, a developer can safely use third-party
            libraries by ensuring they are confined once granted
            access to sensitive information.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-12">
            <h4>Privileges</h4>
            <p>
    In today's model, when the browser retrieves a page from https://example.com,
    any script within the context for the page is trusted not to violate the
    security concerns of https://example.com.  This is natural: https://example.com
    should be allowed to dictate how its data is disseminated! In COWL, this notion
    of <i>trust</i> is made explicit with <i>privileges</i>. 
    Privileges enable code to act on behalf of a page's origin and thus avoid
    becoming confined when reading data sensitive to that origin. Equally importantly,
    however, COWL allows code to "drop" its privileges or delegate them to other
    trustworthy code. Developers can use this primitive to build
    applications that adhere to the <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege">principle
    of least privilege</a>.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p>
These simple three primitives are amenable to a fast browser layout
engine-level implementation, without any modifications to the
underlying JavaScript engine.  Moreover, because they extend already
familiar concepts (<i>e.g.,</i> contexts, postMessage, and
XMLHttpRequest), we believe developers will find them a natural means
for exerting additional control over the privacy of the data they
curate. An example (see link above) illustrates how the COWL API can
be used to confine a third-party password strength-checker library;
our paper details three other common application design patterns.

            <h3>Example: Confining  a password strength-checker with COWL</a></h3>
            <p>
            COWL can be used to build several common types of application securely.
            Our paper describes several examples, including an
            encrypted document editor, an app that relies on jQuery, a third-party
            mashup, and a password strength checker. We will release the code for all of these soon,
            but for now let's see how we can confine a third-party library such as
            a password strength-checker.
            </p>
            <p>
            Suppose the developer of the page https://example.com wants to use the password strength
            checker from http://sketchy.ru/checker.js. Maybe the developers at sketchy.ru are not
            malicious, but the developer doesn't trust them to write bug-free code.
            Note that the checker may need to communicate with sketchy.ru to fetch data
            that it needs to do its job.
            (For a more realistic library, <i>e.g.,</i> the syntax highlighter running in this page, this is desirable functionality.)
            How does the developer use COWL to ensure that the checker
            won't leak a user's password to sketchy.ru or any
            other site?
            </p>

            <div>
            <h4> Step 1: load the checker in a new labeled context </h4>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
   // In example.com page, create new context:
   var checker = new LWorker("http://sketchy.ru/checker.js");
</pre>

            An <var>LWorker</var> is a lightweight labeled worker, COWL's
            approach to creating cheap labeled contexts. (These are similar to
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_worker">Web Workers</a>,
            but labeled and run in the same thread as the parent.)
            This code simply creates a new context and starts running the untrusted
            checker code in this context.
            (<emph>Note:</emph> If you are using the preliminary
            release of COWL, to run this code you will need to include
            <a href="http://cowl.ws/cowl.js">cowl.js</a> to use the
            LWorker API.)
            </div>

            <div>
            <h4> Step 2: register handler to get result</h4>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
   // In example.com page, register message handler waiting for result
   checker.onmessage = function(result) {
     console.log('Password is: ' + result.toString());
   };
</pre>
            Since all communication between labeled contexts is done by
            message passing, we register a handler to be invoked once the
            checker sends us the result.
            </div>

            <div>
            <h4> Step 3: send password</h4>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
   // Is the password sensitive? Yes, label it with example.com!
   var labeledPassword = new LabeledBlob(password, "http://example.com");
   // Send the checker the labeled password:
   checker.postMessage(labeledPassword);
</pre>

            Finally, let's send the checker the password so it can do its job.
            Since the password is sensitive, though, we label it with the
            origin it's sensitive to: example.com. Now when when the checker
            reads the password, it will be confined!
            </div>

            <div>
            <h4> The checker code</h4>
            <p>
            Our code expects the checker to use message passing. What might
            this code look like? Here is one possibility:
            </p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
  // In checker.js, register handler waiting for request from parent:
  onmessage = function(labeledPass) {
    if (doneLoading) {
      // Taint contex to preserve privacy or password
      COWL.privacyLabel = COWL.privacyLabel.and(labeledPass.privacy);
      // Now we can read the password
      var password = labeledPass.blob;
      // Cannot communicate with sketchy.ru anymore, but can reply to parent:
      postMessage(checkStrength(password));
    }
  };
  // .. use XHLHttpRequest to communicate with arbitrary sites
</pre>

            This checker code starts out unconfined: it can communicate with arbitrary
            web sites to fetch any data it needs.
            However, once it has finished doing so (indicated by <var>doneLoading</var>)
            and the parent has supplied it the labeled password, it can proceed to check
            the strength of the password. Specifically, in the <var>onmessage</var> handler,
            the code extracts the password from the labeled blob--at which point COWL
            taints the context--and computes the strength with the
            <var>checkStrength</var> function.
            Once the code has inspected the password COWL confines it, preventing it from
            communicating arbitrarily.
            The code can, of course, send the containing example.com page the
            strength of the password.

            <h4> Take-away: privacy AND functionality</h4>
            Even this simple example illustrates how COWL achieves
            two properties that are today generally mutally exclusive:
            the password strength checker has the <i>flexibility</i>
            to communicate as necessary, but once it actually has
            inspected the password, it is thereafter prevented from
            communicating arbitrarily so as to
            ensure <i>privacy</i>. Today developers can either opt for
            functionality by allowing
            the checker to communicate arbitrarily (even after reading
            sensitive data) or privacy by
            disallowing it from communicating at all (or not using the library in the first place).
